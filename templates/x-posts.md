```

## Example: Hack News
```
$27M gone. Not from a smart contract bug. From a phished exec.

Step Finance's treasury got drained because:
- One compromised inbox
- No multi-sig on critical wallets
- Zero operational security training

Your audit can be perfect. Your OpSec can't be optional.
```

## Example: Audit Theater
```
58% of hacked protocols in 2024 had "passed" audits.

Audits are point-in-time snapshots. They don't catch:
→ Post-deployment changes
→ Oracle manipulation at scale
→ Economic attacks on live markets
→ Compromised team keys

One-time audit ≠ continuous security
```

## Example: Bug Bounty News
```
$3M for ONE bug. That's what @immunefi just paid out.

Meanwhile, protocols are still:
❌ Launching without audits
❌ Capping bounties at $50k
❌ Having zero monitoring
❌ Using copy-paste contracts

The math isn't mathing.
```

## Example: Contrarian Take
```
Unpopular opinion: Most "security researchers" are just running Slither and adding ChatGPT summaries.

Real security requires:
- Understanding business logic
- Testing economic invariants
- Simulating attack scenarios
- Continuous monitoring

Pattern matching ≠ security
```

## Example: Data Shock
```
January 2024: $86M stolen across 16 hacks.

That's $5.4M per hack average.
That's ~$2.8M per DAY.
That's $1.9K per MINUTE going to attackers.

And we're still debating if security is "worth the cost."
