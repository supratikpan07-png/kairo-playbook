## For Protocol Launches (Highest Priority)

### Subject Lines
- "Security before [Launch Date]?"
- "Quick question about [Protocol]'s launch security"
- "[Protocol] + continuous monitoring"

### Body
```
[Name],

Saw [Protocol] is launching [timeline]. Congrats on the momentum.

At your scale, smart contracts will be prime targets from day one. Traditional audits are great, but they're point-in-time snapshots - they won't catch what happens after deployment.

We built Kairo specifically for protocols at your stage - AI-powered scanning that catches vulnerabilities audits miss, integrated into your CI/CD so nothing ships without review.

Worth 15 minutes before launch to see what we'd flag?

## For Post-Funding

### Subject Lines
- "Now that [Company] raised, security should be next"
- "Congrats on the round - quick security question"
- "[Company]'s security stack"

### Body
```
[Name],

Congrats on the [round size] [round type]. That's a major milestone.

Now that you have runway, security should be top of the list. We've seen too many protocols lose months of work (and user funds) because security was an afterthought.

Kairo gives you continuous AI-powered monitoring - not just a one-time audit that's outdated by your next deployment. We integrate directly into your workflow.

Would love to show you what we're seeing in similar protocols. 15 min call?

## For Audit Firms (Partnership)

### Subject Lines
- "Partnership idea: [Firm] + Kairo AI"
- "Augment [Firm]'s audits with AI"
- "Scale [Firm]'s capacity without scaling headcount"

### Body
```
[Name],

[Firm] has a strong reputation for [specific thing they're known for]. The demand for quality audits is only growing.

We built Kairo as an AI-powered scanning layer that complements manual audits - catches the obvious stuff automatically, freeing your auditors to focus on business logic and complex interactions.

Some audit firms are white-labeling our tech to increase throughput without expanding headcount. Could be interesting for [Firm].

Open to a quick call to explore?

## For DeFi Protocols (Customer)

### Subject Lines
- "Quick question about [Protocol]'s ongoing security"
- "[Protocol]'s attack surface is growing"
- "Security gap in [specific feature they launched]"

### Body
```
[Name],

[Protocol] handles [impressive metric - TVL, volume, users]. That's a massive attack surface that doesn't stop evolving.

Traditional audits are point-in-time. They miss the vulnerabilities introduced in your next deployment. We built Kairo to solve exactly this - continuous AI-powered scanning that catches issues before they hit mainnet.

Given your scale, you probably have internal security processes. Curious what gaps you're seeing - would be worth a 15 min call to compare notes.

## For Post-Hack (Competitor/Similar Protocol)

### Subject Lines
- "After [Hacked Protocol] - your security posture"
- "Learning from [Hacked Protocol]'s exploit"
- "[Vulnerability Type] just cost someone $[Amount]"

### Body
```
[Name],

Saw what happened with [Hacked Protocol]. [Brief description of hack].

[Protocol] has similar [architecture/features/exposure]. The same attack vector could apply.

Kairo's continuous monitoring would have caught [specific vulnerability type] before deployment. We're helping protocols like yours implement detection for exactly these patterns.

Worth a quick call to review [Protocol]'s exposure? No pitch, just useful intel.

### Body
```
[Name],

Following up - I know [busy time / launch prep / etc.].

Quick version: Kairo = AI security monitoring that catches what audits miss. 15 min to show you what we'd flag in [Protocol]?

Hey [Name], shot you an email about [Protocol]'s security - might have hit spam.
